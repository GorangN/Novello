Two minor issues identified but do not affect core functionality: 1) Invalid ISBN returns 200 instead of 404 (acceptable due to Open Library's broader coverage), 2) Deleted book verification returns 400 instead of 404 (deletion still works correctly). Google Books API is blocked (403 status) but Open Library fallback is functioning perfectly. All business logic working as expected including progress calculation and automatic completion handling."
