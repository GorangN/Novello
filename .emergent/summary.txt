<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a cross-platform book reading tracker app named Novello using React Native (Expo Router), FastAPI, and MongoDB. Initial development focused on core features: ISBN scanning (with Google Books API, falling back to Open Library, then DNB for German books), book status categories, reading progress, and data storage. The engineer encountered and resolved numerous frontend (Expo Router navigation, environment variables, UI rendering, web-specific components, pull-to-refresh) and backend (API endpoint testing, timezone issues, DNB XML parsing) challenges. Authentication (Email/Password, Google Login) and cloud sync were implemented, along with search/filter, notes, and reading statistics. A major recurring challenge was the  module's compatibility with Expo Go and web, leading to platform-specific code and ongoing debugging. The app currently supports most features, but the scanner functionality on Expo Go remains problematic due to module loading and routing issues.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, lightweight mobile app for iPhone and Android using React Native, to track book reading progress and manage a personal library.
**Core Features:**
*   **ISBN Scanner:** Use device camera to scan ISBN, fetch book info (title, author, cover, total pages) from an API (Google Books API, Open Library API, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB) API for German books).
*   **Book Status Categories:** Read, Currently Reading, Want to Read, with ability to move books between them.
*   **Reading Progress:** Input current page number, app calculates and updates progress with a progress bar.
*   **Book Details View:** Shows cover, title, author, total pages, current page, progress. Option to mark as finished.
*   **Data Storage:** Initially local, later cloud sync with user authentication.
*   **User Authentication:** Google, Apple, Email/Password login for cloud sync.
*   **Additional Features (Requested Later):** Search/filter books, notes/reviews for each book, reading statistics (books per month), profile button in header.
*   **UI/UX:** Modern, clean, light-colored UI (white, light gray, pastel tones, light blue accents). Rounded corners, subtle shadows, smooth animations, easy-to-read typography, clear navigation, minimal layout. Implemented pull-to-refresh.
*   **Technical:** React Native (Expo Router), TypeScript, FastAPI backend, MongoDB for data storage. App must be lightweight, fast, battery-friendly.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core FastAPI backend application.
    -   **Summary**: Handles all API endpoints for books (CRUD operations), user authentication (login, registration, session management), and external book data fetching (Google Books, Open Library, DNB). It was extensively modified to handle German ISBNs via DNB, implement authentication, and fix date timezone issues.
-   **/app/frontend/app/index.tsx**: Entry point for the frontend, primarily redirects to the main tabs.
    -   **Summary**: Initially the main screen, now functions as a redirect to the default  tab within the  navigation.
-   **/app/frontend/app/_layout.tsx**: Defines the main navigation structure using Expo Router's Tabs.
    -   **Summary**: Configures the bottom tab navigator for Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read screens. It also includes the  wrapper for global authentication context and a profile button in the header.
-   **/app/frontend/app/currently-reading.tsx, want-to-read.tsx, read.tsx**: Screens displaying books based on their status.
    -   **Summary**: These screens list books from the backend, allow interaction (view details, update progress), and include pull-to-refresh functionality. Their import paths were adjusted during navigation refactoring.
-   **/app/frontend/app/login.tsx, register.tsx, profile.tsx**: Authentication-related screens.
    -   **Summary**: Enable user login, registration, and display user profile information respectively.  is accessible via a header button.
-   **/app/frontend/app/search.tsx, stats.tsx**: Additional feature screens.
    -   **Summary**:  provides functionality to search for books.  displays reading statistics and includes pull-to-refresh.
-   **/app/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx**: Provides authentication context globally.
    -   **Summary**: Manages user session (login, logout, registration) using the backend API and provides user data to the rest of the app. It handles token storage and validation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.ts**: Centralizes API calls to the backend.
    -   **Summary**: Contains functions for interacting with book, user, and authentication endpoints. Was updated to handle environment variables correctly (after initial hardcoding) and to support new backend features.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AddBookModal.tsx**: Modal for adding new books, including ISBN scanning.
    -   **Summary**: Manages the ISBN input and camera scanning functionality. It was heavily modified to handle platform-specific scanner implementation (web vs. native) and to correctly process search results.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AddBookModal.web.tsx**: Web-specific version of the AddBookModal.
    -   **Summary**: Provides a fallback for web platforms where the native barcode scanner is not available, allowing manual ISBN entry.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BookCard.tsx**: Component to display individual book information.
    -   **Summary**: Renders book cover, title, author, and progress bar. It was updated to correctly display cover images and ensure the remove button works.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BookDetailsModal.tsx**: Modal to show detailed book information and actions.
    -   **Summary**: Displays comprehensive book details, allows updating progress, marking as finished, and deleting a book. It was fixed to ensure the remove and mark as finished buttons work correctly on web.
-   **/app/frontend/assets/novello_logo.png**: The application logo.
    -   **Summary**: Added as per user request to be used in the app's branding.
-   **/app/README.md**: Project documentation.
    -   **Summary**: Updated to include details about the tech stack, deployment, and overall application architecture for potential customers.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix  on Expo Go:** The scanner functionality is still encountering errors on the Expo Go app ( and Route is missing the required default export).
-   **Google Login:** The Google Login functionality was not explicitly confirmed to be working in the latest logs, and previous attempts failed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging and attempting to fix the  functionality within the Expo Go app. The user reported a persistent error on Expo Go after previous attempts to fix the scanner. The latest console logs indicated a routing error () alongside the  issue. The engineer had just tried to implement a lazy loading mechanism for the  and was addressing the routing error by updating the permission request logic.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will implement lazy loading for  and fix the routing errors to ensure the scanner works correctly on Expo Go.
